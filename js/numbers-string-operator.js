//Types of Number in JS
//Integers are floating-point numbers without a fraction. They can either be positive or negative, e.g. 10, 400, or -5.
//Floating point numbers (floats) have decimal points and decimal places, for example 12.5, and 56.7786543.
//Doubles are a specific type of floating point number that have greater precision than standard floating point numbers (meaning that they are accurate to a greater number of decimal places).
