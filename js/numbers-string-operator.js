//Types of Number in JS
//Integers are floating-point numbers without a fraction. They can either be positive or negative, e.g. 10, 400, or -5.
//Floating point numbers (floats) have decimal points and decimal places, for example 12.5, and 56.7786543.
//Doubles are a specific type of floating point number that have greater precision than standard floating point numbers (meaning that they are accurate to a greater number of decimal places).

const myInt = 5;
const myFloat = 6.667;

//String
//declearing a String
const string = "The revolution will not be televised.";
//there are two types of wraping in JS
//Single Quotes Vs. double Quotes
const sgl = 'Single quotes.';
const dbl = "Double quotes";
//he browser will think the string has not been closed because the other type of quote you are not using to contain your strings can appear in the string. For example, both of these are okay:
const sglDbl = 'Would you eat a "fish supper"?';
const dblSgl = "I'm feeling blue.";

//Escaping characters in a string
//add more info on this
const bigmouth = 'I\'ve got no right to take my placeâ€¦';
