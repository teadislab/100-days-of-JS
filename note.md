HARSH TRUTHS ABOUT LIFE

You don't value enough of what you already have.
Your one negative thought is as powerful as your five positive thoughts.
You can ACTUALLY change your past by changing the underlying meaning of those memories.
The smarter you get, the more friends you lose.
Your fear of embarrassing yourself is the biggest hurdle to your growth.
The more empty your mind, the faster it gets. The more cluttered your mind, the slower it gets.
You don't suck at managing your time, you just don't know how valuable it is.
The more available you are, the less respected you'd be.
You will have to walk some paths alone because goals are personal; no one has your dreams.
No one is coming to save you. Your life is 100% your responsibility.
Which one hit the hardest?

The most valuable life is knowing how to be alone, but not have to.

It doesn’t matter what time you wake up everyday. What matters is that you wake up at the same time everyday.
